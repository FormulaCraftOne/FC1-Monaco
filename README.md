Minecraft Ice Boat Racing follows F1 to the Monaco GP, hosted live at the 1:1 scale recreation of the Circuit de Monaco!

Note, if you have any problems with the spawn location, do /tp @p 3056678 5 -4355439

This map, and notably all the good looking buildings, were created by the Build the Earth Team. They used terra 1:1 OSM data, to get the scaling of the roads correctly. As for modifications from the Appleseed Boat Gang, the roads were converted to ice, and water elevator systems were implemented to go up the height elevation of the map! You may also notice that the elevation of the upper Monaco Plateau was slightly reduced so that overall the track is faster to do with boats (elevation changes generally can slow you down a lot).
